        hg = th.bartz(T0,Tw,p0,Mg,rt*2,aRatio,mug,cpg,Prg,gg,cstar)
T0 = from CEA File (starting temperature I think)
Tw = Temperature of wall. STarts at 400, which I think is like an initial guess
p0 = from CEA File (starting pressure I think)
Mg = from CEA File (interpolation of data)  (Molar mass)
rt = Radius of throat
aRatio = Ratio of area at station to Area at throat
mug = from CEA File (interpolation of data)  (Viscosity??)
cpg = from CEA File (interpolation of data)  (specific heat capacity at constant pressure)
Prg = from CEA File (interpolation of data)  (PRESSURE)
gg = from CEA File (interpolation of data)   (NOT SURE)
cstar = from CEA File



Nu = th.Taylor(Re,Pr,T,TwChannel,Dh,x)   [ IS THIS THE RIGHT FORMULA FOR RP-1]
Re = Renolyds number
Pr = Prantl Number
T  = Temperature of coolant
TwChannel = Temperature of channel wall near coolant
Dh = Hydraulic diameter of channel.
x  = Where the station is.




Dh = th.Dh_rect(channelWidth,channelHeight)
channelWidth = channelWidth at station
channelHeight = channelHeight at station





# COOLANT:  Calculate bulk flow properties of coolant
Re = V*rho*Dh/mu
V = Speed of coolant
rho = Density of coolant.
Dh = Hydraulic diameter of channel
mu = Viscosity of Coolant (Dynamic viscosity, Pa a)




Pr = mu*cp/kap
mu = Viscosity of Coolant (Dynamic viscosity, Pa a)
cp = specific heat capacity at constant pressure of coolant.
kap = Thermal conductivity of coolant.




Nu = Nu*Ci*Cksi
Nu = nusselt number
Ci = Correction for curvature of channels
Cksi = Correction for something else?   [JOE TO INVESTIGATE]




hc = Nu*kap/Dh
Nu = nusselt number
kap = Thermal conductivity of coolant.
Dh = Hydraulic diameter of channel.



# Incorporate heat transfer fin effectiveness into hc (Heat Transfer coefficient for hot gases)
m = np.sqrt(2*hc*tRib/kChamber)
hc = heat coefficient calculated previously
tRib = Thickness of rib - Channel design.
kChamber = Thermal conductivity of channel material (copper)



finEffectiveness = np.tanh(m/tRib*channelHeight)/(m/tRib*channelHeight)
m = defined previously. See above.
<rest are channel dimensions>



hc = hc*(channelWidth + finEffectiveness*2*channelHeight) / (channelWidth+tRib)
channelWidth = Width of channel
finEffectiveness = Defined previously.
channelHeight = Height of channel
tRib = Thickness of material between channels. [Is it 1/2 this value?]









# Calculate radiative heat transfer (Suspect this is for the MAIN products of combustion)
qW = 5.74 * (pWater/1e5*Rnozzle)**0.3 * (Taw/100)**3.5    # Water
pWater  = From CEA Data [DENSITY OF WATER]
Rnozzle = Radius of nozzle at current station.
Taw     = Adiabatic temperature of gases at wall.




qC = 4 * (pCarbDiox/1e5*Rnozzle)**0.3 * (Taw/100)**3.5    # Carbon Dioxide
pCarbDiox  = Density of Carbon Dioxide gas at station
Taw     = Adiabatic temperature of gases at wall.





qRad = qW+qC
= Sum of two quantities above

Rad = Radiant.
